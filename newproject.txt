## Goals 
1. Detect fraudulent emails and remove them from the panel. 
1. Determine which features appear in fraudulent emails compared to 
non-fraudulent ones. 
1. Compare email data to other datasets to verify their validity. 
 
## Methodology 
 
### Feature Engineering Ideas 
1. Analyze and pull names in email addresses to see if they correspond to 
names given in the survey or in datasets such as the census 
1. Look for whether a personâ€™s initials appear in the email address 
1. Check whether email addresses include birthdays or dates in general 
1. See how many special characters and what type of characters are 
included, how obscure and uncommon 
1. Check email domains (gmail.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com, etc.) 
1. See if any places are mentioned in the email that correspond to a 
location given in the survey. 
1. Look for frequently used words (other than names/places) 
 
### Additional Data that may be useful: 
1. Census (first/last name, birthdays, location) 
1. Social media account names, check if email name corresponds 
1. There are additional email datasets listing known spam and phishing 
emails, potential overlap with these.
